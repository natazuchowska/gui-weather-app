# AgroWeather App :farmer:

Welcome to AgroWeather! This is a weather app made for farmers and anyone who is interested in the agriculture world. This app focuses providing farmers with the weather resources they need to improve yield and to help with preparations using the forecast.

This is a team project for a GUI Computer Science module created by a team of 4 students.

We faced some challenges throughout this project such as working through some of the APIs. We overcame these challenges by simply asking for help, whether it is from demonstrators or people within our team.

We hope you enjoy AgroWeather!

## Features of AgroWeather
### Search Bar :mag:
AgroWeather has implemented a search bar that allows users to view the weather from all around the world. Simply by typing the location, the user is able to view the weekly forecast and the crops suitable for that weather.

### Crops Suitable for this weather :leafy_green:
This page gives an idea of what crops are great to grow in the current weather they are viewing. This is extremely helpful when farmers are planning to grow some new crops and need an idea of what weather confitions are suitable.

### Profile Page :adult:
The profile page allows the user to make the app more personal.
